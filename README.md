#Gym Tracker
    - I have always had the problem of watching youtube videos searching for the perfect workout split.
    - Creating a simply py script that has my workout split coded.
    - Current logic : 
        - INPUTS -  Takes user name , email , height , day of the week
        - Calculates BMI  
        - Tells part to train : Parses JSON of the workout
    - Library Used - pprint
    - Scale Up operation - planning to add emails logic which will send entire week schedule
